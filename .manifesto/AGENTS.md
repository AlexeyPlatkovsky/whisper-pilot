# Maintain Version Frontmatter

Use this skill whenever a task changes the `agent-manifest` framework itself.

This file is not part of the Agent Manifesto framework. Its only purpose is to maintain correct project version bumping.
Do not treat it as a framework source when discussing or designing framework changes. Apply it only when a task requires a project version bump.

This repository is versioned as a single unit. The following files must always share the same `version` value in YAML frontmatter:
- `MANIFEST.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `README.md`
- `conventions/*.md`
- `00_project_profile.md`
- `01_initial_composition.md`
- `02_review.md`
- `03_capability_expansion.md`
- `04_tool_adoption.md`
- `protocols/*.md`
- `agents/*.md`

## Rules

1. Read the frontmatter of all files before editing any of them.
2. Keep the `version` field identical across all files at all times.
3. When a framework refactor changes the version, update all files in the same patch.
4. Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## Semantic Version Policy

- PATCH: wording fixes and clarifications
- MINOR: new skills, new rules, or structural additions
- MAJOR: breaking changes to the framework contract

## Verification

Before declaring the task complete:

1. Re-read the frontmatter in all files.
2. Confirm the `version` values are identical.
3. Confirm the bump level matches the kind of change made.
4. If any file was missed, fix it before reporting completion.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages must describe the project-level change (what was changed, added, patched, fixed, restructured, removed).

Do not frame commits around the version bump itself:
- avoid titles like `Bump version to X`, `Version sync`, `Patch bump for Y`
- prefer titles that describe the substantive change (`Rework README as how-to guide`, `Add README to versioned file set`)

The version change is visible in the diff and the release tag — the commit message should explain the change that justified the bump, not restate the bump.
