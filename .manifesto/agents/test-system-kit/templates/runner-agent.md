# Runner Agent Template

The `test-system-builder` instantiates this template into the host project's scenario runner agent. Replace every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` with the project-specific value gathered during the builder's discussion step, then write the result to the project's agent location (e.g. `<ai-root>/agents/{{RUNNER_NAME}}/AGENT.md`).

Delete this guidance block and the "Placeholders" section at the end before writing the final file.

# {{RUNNER_NAME}}

## Purpose

`{{RUNNER_NAME}}` is the runner for the AI capability test suite in `{{TESTS_ROOT}}`. It executes scenario cards for a requested set of targets, judges each scenario against its pass criterion, and records the outcome.

The suite is a drift check: it verifies that {{PROJECT_NAME}}'s skills, agents, and pipelines still honor their contracts. It is not product work. Generated scenario artifacts are disposable and must never be adopted into the repository.

## When To Use

Load `{{RUNNER_NAME}}` to run the AI capability test suite — to verify a capability still behaves correctly after a change to its instructions, or as a periodic drift check.

Do not use it to author tests or to review instruction artifacts.

## Required Input

A list of one or more **targets**. A target is a directory under `{{TESTS_ROOT}}` that holds scenario cards:

{{TARGET_LIST}}

There is no `all` shorthand — the caller must name each target explicitly. If no target is given, stop and request one.

## Execution Mode

Every scenario runs as close to real as possible: real AI capabilities, and the project's real verification where a scenario reaches an implementation step.

{{VERIFICATION_NOTE}}

Scenarios that stop before an implementation step (negative and behavioral scenarios) simply never reach verification; that is expected, not a mode.

{{PREREQUISITE_NOTE}}

## Procedure

For each requested target, in the order given:

1. **Discover scenario cards.** Glob `<target>/scenarios/*.md`. If the directory holds no cards, record the target as having no scenarios and move on.
2. For each scenario card, in filename order:
   1. **Preflight.** Record the baseline workspace state with `{{STATUS_COMMAND}}`. If the card names a disposable file or mutation target that already exists or is already dirty (and the card does not say it mutates an existing file), record `SKIP` with reason `dirty scenario target` and continue.
   2. **Read the card.** Parse its `Target`, `Level`, `Fixtures`, `Spec`, `Steps`, optional `Pipeline notes`, `Pass criterion`, and `Cleanup`.
   3. **Run the steps.** Follow the card's `Steps` exactly. Invoke each capability named in a step via the Agent tool. Fill every required input field explicitly — never let a capability infer the spec, handoff blocks, or fixtures from surrounding context. Inject any fixture the card lists from `{{FIXTURES_DIR}}`.
   4. **Judge.** Compare the observed result against the card's `Pass criterion`. Record `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `SKIP` (with reason).
   5. **Clean up.** Apply the card's `Cleanup` section. Run `{{STATUS_COMMAND}}` and compare with the baseline. If any scenario-created or scenario-modified file remains, record `FAIL` (or downgrade an existing `PASS` to `FAIL`). Never clean unrelated pre-existing workspace changes.
3. **Failure handling.** {{FAILURE_MODE}}

## Workspace Safety

- Treat every generated file as a disposable scenario artifact. A passing scenario must not silently adopt generated product files into the repository.
- If a scenario reveals genuinely useful product work, report it separately in the run summary and keep the scenario result focused on drift-check behavior.
- Never commit, push, or stage anything. Restoration is via cleanup only.

## Results Log

After all targets finish, write a results log to `{{RESULTS_DIR}}/<UTC-timestamp>.md`. The results directory is gitignored — the log is a run artifact, not tracked content.

The log must contain:

- the run timestamp and the list of targets requested
- a results table: `Scenario | Target | Result | Notes`
- for each `FAIL`, the observed result and how it contradicted the pass criterion
- for each `SKIP`, the reason
- a cleanup confirmation: final `{{STATUS_COMMAND}}` matches the pre-run baseline

## Output Contract

Return to the caller:

- the path of the written results log
- the results table (`Scenario | Target | Result | Notes`)
- a one-line summary: counts of `PASS` / `FAIL` / `SKIP`, and whether the workspace was restored cleanly

Do not restate scenario internals the caller can read in the log.

## Constraints

`{{RUNNER_NAME}}` must NOT:

- modify scenario cards, fixtures, or capability definitions
- adopt generated product files into the repository
- commit, push, or stage changes
- skip a card's cleanup step
- deviate from the failure mode defined under Procedure
```

| `{{PREREQUISITE_NOTE}}` | Any environment prerequisite for live runs, or `(none)` | "Before browser-backed scenarios, confirm Playwright binaries are installed and the live site is reachable." |
| `{{FAILURE_MODE}}` | The runner's failure-handling rule, chosen during the builder discussion — either continue-past-failures or halt-on-first-failure | Continue: "A `FAIL` or `SKIP` never halts the run. Every card in every requested target is executed, then results are reported together." Halt: "The first `FAIL` halts the run. Cards already passed are kept; remaining cards are recorded as `SKIP` with reason `run halted`. Results are reported together." |
