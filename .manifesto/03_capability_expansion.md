# 03_capability_expansion.md — Capability Expansion

## Context Required

Before starting, ensure the following files are available in this session:
- `MANIFEST.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- all framework convention files under `conventions/`
- `protocols/_README.md`
- frontmatter for all canonical protocol files under `protocols/`, excluding `protocols/_README.md`; full bodies only for triggered protocols
- frontmatter for all canonical agent template files under `agents/`, excluding `agents/_README.md`; full bodies only for triggered templates
- `.ai/docs/project_specification.md`
- the current instruction system: root contract, skills, pipelines, agents, conventions, and docs

If `.ai/docs/project_specification.md` is missing, stop and require `00_project_profile.md` first.

If other required context is missing, stop and ask for it.

Use `protocols/_README.md` only as an inventory index. Derive capabilities using `conventions/capability-derivation.md`.

---

## Purpose

Expand a correct baseline instruction system into a more complete one that reflects real team habits and recurring work.

Use `.ai/docs/project_specification.md` as the authoritative profile source for role, duties, quality expectations, and accepted assumptions.

When the user already asks for specific new capabilities, keep expansion anchored to that explicit request instead of resetting to broad discovery of team habits.

This stage is not for building from scratch.
It assumes `01_initial_composition.md` already produced a valid baseline.

It is not for adopting external tools, libraries, or frameworks.
If the user's request bundles tool adoption with capability expansion, split the work: run `03_capability_expansion.md` first, then hand off tool adoption to `04_tool_adoption.md`.

---

## Working Mode

Work in exactly 4 phases:
1. Discovery
2. Brainstorm trigger check
3. Proposal
4. Composition

During the Brainstorm trigger check, use `protocols/brainstorm.md` only when an unresolved high-impact decision has meaningful options.
During Proposal, present the full proposal at once.
During Composition, do not return to brainstorming. Pause only for explicit approval or clarification gates required by `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

---

## Phase 1 — Discovery

Read the current instruction system and identify:
- what `.ai/docs/project_specification.md` says the user does most often
- what skills, pipelines, agents, conventions, and docs already exist
- what recurring work they already cover
- what important recurring work is still missing
- whether any existing skill actually represents a repeated non-trivial workflow that needs a pipeline
- whether the user already named concrete additions or target responsibilities
- which design decisions are still genuinely open versus already decided by the user request
- whether the current system still matches protocol requirements
- whether the current system still matches required agent template metadata
- whether duplication or blurred responsibilities have crept in

If no current instruction system exists, or if a valid baseline cannot be confirmed, stop and require `01_initial_composition.md` or a review/fix pass before expansion.

Provide a brief current-state summary, then move to Phase 2.
Do not propose solutions yet.

---

## Phase 2 — Brainstorm Trigger Check

Determine whether `protocols/brainstorm.md` is triggered by unresolved high-impact decisions with meaningful options.

If no such decision exists, record that brainstorming is not triggered and proceed to Phase 3 without asking a brainstorm question.

When brainstorming is triggered, ask only about unresolved high-impact decisions.

If the user already requested concrete additions, start with a scoped question about that requested capability set.
Do not reset to a broad "typical day or week" discovery prompt.

Use a broad recurring-work question only when the request is intentionally open-ended and the missing capability areas are still unknown.

When brainstorming is triggered, `protocols/brainstorm.md` owns the question format and decision-summary requirements.

Explore only areas not already covered well by the existing system, such as:
- review habits
- release or deployment routines
- testing and debugging patterns
- onboarding
- docs maintenance
- shared coding, review, testing, or domain standards
- recurring cross-team coordination
- constraints or variants of the explicitly requested capability set

Do not ask for broad workflow narration when Discovery and the user request already provide enough evidence to discuss the requested additions directly.

Stop when:
- the user has described the meaningful recurring work
- no major new pipelines or specialized roles are emerging
- you have enough evidence to justify a concrete proposal

Before leaving Phase 2, ask a final protocol-compliant question when meaningful options remain, then produce the required decision summary.

After producing a brainstorm decision summary, stop for user confirmation before Composition can begin. Proposal approval may count only if it explicitly confirms the decisions.

---

## Phase 3 — Proposal

Present the complete proposed delta all at once.

Group proposals by type:
1. Skills
2. Pipelines
3. Agents
4. Conventions
5. Docs
6. Required compliance fixes

For each proposed addition, provide:
- name
- type
- purpose
- what user-described need justifies it
- what existing artifacts it depends on
- why it belongs in that layer, and for an execution capability why it is a skill or an agent per `conventions/skill-vs-agent.md`

Include mandatory protocol-derived capabilities, mandatory copied agents, and compliance fixes in the proposed delta before asking for approval.

Before presenting, verify that each proposal:
- does not duplicate an existing artifact
- fits the correct layer
- uses a pipeline, not only a skill, when the recurring work has distinct ordered steps, validation, or review gates
- is justified by actual repository or user evidence

Ask the user to approve, reject, or modify the proposal set before implementation.

---

## Phase 4 — Composition

Begin only after explicit user approval and any required brainstorm decision confirmation.

Apply `IMPLEMENTATION.md` §Stage Standards §Composition Anchor.

Stage-specific rules:
- for every present mandatory protocol trigger, reuse an exact existing project capability or materialize the required standalone project capability before any optional addition
- for every present mandatory agent template trigger, reuse an exact existing project-local agent or copy the required template before accepting new instruction artifacts
- apply `conventions/traceability.md` to every new or changed non-trivial routed handoff
- if an existing capability or agent is close but non-equivalent, stop and ask whether to split, preserve, replace, or add another artifact
- verify the project-local instruction-evaluator agent exists, then use it to review new or changed instruction artifacts before final acceptance
- verify the project-local artifact-acceptance-tester agent exists when its trigger applies, then use it to run 9 scenario tests for each new or materially changed runtime instruction artifact before final acceptance
- preserve existing good artifacts unless the user approved changes
- update the root contract's capability registry section, or the project's existing separate registry if one exists, with each new capability

## Final Summary

After implementation, report:
1. what was added
2. what was updated
3. what was intentionally excluded
4. remaining gaps
5. compliance confirmation
